# unity-fusionwars
A Game Jam game created in Unity at Bournemouth University, UK.(June 2016)

The theme for this Game Jam was "Fusion".

This is a local two-player game that fuses turn-based strategy and card play. Fuse cards together to create new units and structures, and place them on the board. Engage enemy units with your own, with intent to destroy the enemy castle.
